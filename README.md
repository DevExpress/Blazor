3. Install the "DevExpress.RazorComponents" NuGet package.
4. Obtain the client runtime directory from the GitHub repository - download all files from this directory. Put the downloaded files in the "wwwroot" directory of your project. Include that files to your start page.
5. Register our tag namespace and helper in /Components/_ViewImports.cshtml: 
```
@using DevExpress.RazorComponents
@addTagHelper *, DevExpress.RazorComponents
```
6. Your application is ready to use DevExpress Razor Components.

# Troubleshooting

## 1. DxDataGrid in Blazor

If you use Blazor (client-side hosting via MonoWASM) with DxDataGrid, you may find the following exception in the browser:

![Troubleshooting - No Generic Method 'Take' On Type System.Linq.Queryable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevExpress/RazorComponents/master/media/Troubleshooting-NoGenericMethodTakeOnTypeSystemLinqQueryable.png)

> "System.InvalidOperationException: No generic method 'Take' on type 'System.Linq.Queryable' is compatible with the supplied type arguments and arguments."

Please refer the [original mono issue in github for a solution](https://github.com/mono/mono/issues/12917#issuecomment-462925005):

Or, your can just turn off the linker. To do this, navigate to your [ProjectName].Client.csproj and add the following line:

```
<BlazorLinkOnBuild>false</BlazorLinkOnBuild>
```

So, the project content looks as follows:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
  ...
    <BlazorLinkOnBuild>false</BlazorLinkOnBuild>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ...
</Project>
```
## 2. The "Early Access" NuGet Feed is empty in Visual Studio

If you don't see packages in the ```https://nuget.devexpress.com/early-access/api``` NuGet feed, make sure that the "Include prerelease" option is selected:
