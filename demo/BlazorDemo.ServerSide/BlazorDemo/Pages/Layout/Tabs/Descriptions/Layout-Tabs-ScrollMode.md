Use the [ScrollMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTabs.ScrollMode) property to specify how users navigate between tabs when they do not fit the container's width. The following modes are available:



* **Auto** — the scroll mode is adapted to the device type. Mobile and tablet devices use **Swipe** mode. Desktop devices use **NavButtons** mode.



* **NavButtons** — the container displays a few tabs that fit the width. Users can navigate to other tabs in the following ways: use the navigation buttons, or hover the mouse pointer over a tab, hold the Shift key, and scroll the mouse wheel.



* **Swipe** — the container displays a few tabs that fit the width. To navigate to other tabs, users can swipe tabs, or hover the mouse pointer over the container, hold the Shift key, and scroll the mouse wheel.



* **NoScroll** — users cannot scroll tabs. The tabs that do not fit the container's width are moved to a new line.



Use the **Scroll Mode** combobox to switch between different modes.
