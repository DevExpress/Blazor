This demo emulates Card View functionality by using the following DevExpress Blazor components:

* [DxGridLayout](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridLayout) arranges cards into rows and columns.
* [DxPager](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxPager) implements navigation between pages.
* [DxLayoutBreakpoint](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxLayoutBreakpoint) implements layout adaptivity. This component recalculates the page size, active page index, and number of rows and columns in a Grid Layout after the screen changes its size.
