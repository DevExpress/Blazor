Set the [SelectionMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1.SelectionMode) property to [DataGridSelectionMode.MultipleSelectedDataRows](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DataGridSelectionMode) to enable multiple selection in the [Data Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1) component. To select a range of rows, users should hold down the **Shift** key and click the first and last rows in the range. To add/remove a row to/from selection, users should hold down the **Ctrl** key and click the row.

Use the [MultipleSelectedDataRows](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1.MultipleSelectedDataRows) property to access/specify the selected items. To track selection changes in this mode, use the [MultipleSelectedDataRowsChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1.MultipleSelectedDataRowsChanged) event or the two-way synchronization as demonstrated in this module.
