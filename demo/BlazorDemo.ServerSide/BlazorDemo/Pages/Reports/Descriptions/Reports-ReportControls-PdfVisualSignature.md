This demo adds a visual signature to a report.

The document is an agreement that requires signatures from two sides - a client and a contractor. The report includes two <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRPdfSignature" target="_blank">XRPdfSignature</a> controls that will hold those signatures. The demo allows you to sign the agreement as a client. Open the <b>Export Options</b> panel, expand the <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2574/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/store-and-distribute-reports/export-reports/export-to-pdf?f=+export+options#export-from-document-viewer-web-platforms" target="_blank">PDF Export Options</a> section, and select an entry from the <b>Signature</b> drop-down list. Export the document and open it to see a visual signature. The second party can sign the document in Adobe Acrobat Reader.
