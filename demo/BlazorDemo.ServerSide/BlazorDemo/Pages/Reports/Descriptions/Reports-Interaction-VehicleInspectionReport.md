A report in this demo uses the Check Box, Label and Picture Box controls in edit mode to create a customizable Vehicle Inspection Report. Labels allow you to input car data and leave inspection comments. Check Box controls use custom SVG glyphs and are grouped in a way that allows them to behave like radio buttons. The Picture Box uses Signature edit mode, and allows you to specify car damage after external examination.
