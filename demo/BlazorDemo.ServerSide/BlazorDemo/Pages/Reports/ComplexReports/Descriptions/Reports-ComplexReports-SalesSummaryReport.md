This demo illustrates how to use the Cross Tab control to create a Sales Summary report. In this demo, the Cross Tab calculates automatic totals and grand totals across all row and column fields. The top left corner displays row field headers, and row field values are grouped by quarter.

Refer to the Balance Sheet demo for another Cross Tab layout.
