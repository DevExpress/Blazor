Our Blazor [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid) allows you to compute total and group summaries based on custom logic. To create a custom summary, declare a [DxGridSummaryItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem) object in the [TotalSummary](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.TotalSummary) or [GroupSummary](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.GroupSummary) template and set the [SummaryType](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem.SummaryType) property to [Custom](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridSummaryItemType). Then, handle the Grid's [CustomSummary](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.CustomSummary) event to implement the summary calculation algorithm. This event occurs multiple times as follows: 

* Before grid rows are processed. The event argument's [SummaryStage](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridCustomSummaryEventArgs.SummaryStage) property value is [Start](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridCustomSummaryStage). At this stage, you can initialize a summary value. 
* For each data row in the processed range. The [SummaryStage](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridCustomSummaryEventArgs.SummaryStage) property value is [Calculate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridCustomSummaryStage). At this stage, you can calculate a summary value. 
* After grid rows are processed. The [SummaryStage](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridCustomSummaryEventArgs.SummaryStage) property value is [Finalize](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridCustomSummaryStage). At this stage, you can finalize summary calculation. 

To refresh grid summary values, call the [RefreshSummary](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.RefreshSummary) method. You can also handle the [CustomizeSummaryDisplayText](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.CustomizeSummaryDisplayText) event to change the summary's display text. 

In this demo, the custom summary calculates the sum of **Total** values against the selected Grid rows.
