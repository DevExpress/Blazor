The DevExpress Blazor Grid supports interval grouping. Interval grouping allows you to group date-time values by year, month or date, or you can group text values by display text or against individual characters. Use the [DxGridColumn.GroupInterval](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridColumn.GroupInterval) property to specify how data rows are grouped.

In this demo, the **Order Date** column uses interval grouping. Data is grouped by year. You also have options to select other group intervals including: *Month* or *Date*.
