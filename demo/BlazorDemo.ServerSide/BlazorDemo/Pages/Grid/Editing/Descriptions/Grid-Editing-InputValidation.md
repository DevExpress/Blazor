Our Blazor [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/grid) uses the standard [DataAnnotationsValidator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/forms/validation?view=aspnetcore-7.0#data-annotations-validator-component-and-custom-validation) to validate user input (based on [data annotation attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/validation) defined in an edit model). The Grid validates editor values once a user moves focus away from data editors or uses a command that saves changes. In `EditCell` mode, the grid control validates user input when focus moves away from the edited row. The control prevents users from editing a different row until they address all validation errors.

Once validation is completed, the component marks editors with colored outlines and displays validation icons: green for valid values, and red for invalid values. Hover the mouse pointer over an error icon to display the corresponding error message within the tooltip.

You can implement your custom validator components and declare them in the [CustomValidators](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.CustomValidators) template. To disable input validation, set the [ValidationEnabled](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.ValidationEnabled) option to `false`.

**Note**: You should not rely on form validation alone to secure your Blazor-powered app. Form validation is only designed to improve application usability. A threat actor can bypass validation and send malicious data to the server. To minimize security related threats/risks, you must track data changes using multiple strategies. Refer to the following topic for more information: [Validate User Input](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/404263/common-concepts/validate-user-input).
