Our Blazor Grid uses the standard [DataAnnotationsValidator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/forms-validation#data-annotations-validator-component-and-custom-validation-1) to validate user input (based on [data annotation attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/validation) defined in an edit model). Once a user removes focus from data editors or attempts to save an edited row, editors are marked with colored outlines: green indicates valid values, red — invalid values.

You can implement your custom validator components and declare them in the [CustomValidators](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.CustomValidators) template. To disable input validation, set the [ValidationEnabled](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.ValidationEnabled) option to `false`.

**Note**: You should not rely on form validation alone to secure your Blazor-powered app. Form validation is designed to improve usability. A threat actor can bypass validation and send malicious data to the server. To minimize security related threats/risks, you must validate user input using multiple strategies. Refer to the following topic for more information: [Validate User Input](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/404263/common-concepts/validate-user-input).
