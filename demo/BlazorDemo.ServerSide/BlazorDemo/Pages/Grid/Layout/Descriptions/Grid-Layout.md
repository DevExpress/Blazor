The DevExpress Grid for Blazor allows you to save its layout between application work sessions. The [saved information](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridPersistentLayout) includes settings that end users can change: column position, sort order and direction, current page number, filter values, and grouped columns.

To save and restore the component layout, handle the following events:

* [LayoutAutoSaving](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.LayoutAutoSaving) - Raised when the layout settings change. The event's [e.Layout](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridPersistentLayoutEventArgs.Layout) argument contains a [GridPersistentLayout](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridPersistentLayout) object with updated layout settings. Save this object to desired storage (in this demo, the browser's [local storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/state-management?view=aspnetcore-6.0&pivots=server#browser-storage-server) is used). When you need to restore the Grid layout, retrieve the object from the storage and apply it to the Grid (for example, in the `LayoutAutoLoading` event handler).
* [LayoutAutoLoading](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.LayoutAutoLoading) - Raised when the Grid is initialized. The component starts loading the layout after it applies the initial state specified in the markup. To load layout settings from a previously saved [GridPersistentLayout](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridPersistentLayout) object, assign it to this event's [e.Layout](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridPersistentLayoutEventArgs.Layout) argument.

You can also call the [SaveLayout](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.SaveLayout) and [LoadLayout](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.LoadLayout(DevExpress.Blazor.GridPersistentLayout)) methods to save and restore the Grid layout on demand (for example, on a button click).

In this demo, changes that you make persist after a page reload. Reorder and regroup columns, apply filters, switch between pages, and change the page size. Then, click the **Reload Page** button above the Grid and ensure that your changes persist. If you want to reset the layout to the state specified in the markup, click **Reset Layout**.
