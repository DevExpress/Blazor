In both Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly applications, you can use the [GridDevExtremeDataSource\<T>](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridDevExtremeDataSource-1) to bind our Blazor [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/grid) to large data from an HTTP service. This data source implementation is based on our [DevExtreme.AspNet.Data](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data) library. When you use this data source, the Grid delegates data processing operations to an underlying query provider and only loads data required for screen display. 

To use this data source in your next Blazor project, create a [GridDevExtremeDataSource\<T>](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridDevExtremeDataSource-1) class instance and pass a URL to an HTTP service as the constructor parameter. Once complete, assign this instance to the Grid's [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.Data) property. On the service side, [implement an API controller](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/401020/devextreme-based-controls/concepts/bind-controls-to-data/api-controllers) and create action methods that use the [DataSourceLoader](https://devexpress.github.io/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data/net/api/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data.DataSourceLoader.html) class to create a [LoadResult](https://devexpress.github.io/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data/net/api/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data.ResponseModel.LoadResult.html) object based on load options.
