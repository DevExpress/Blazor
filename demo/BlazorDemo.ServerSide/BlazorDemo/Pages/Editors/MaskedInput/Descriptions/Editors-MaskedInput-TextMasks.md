You can use the [Text](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/402516/data-editors/masks/text-masks) mask type when you want to enter strings of limited length, such as phone numbers, zip codes, social security numbers, and so on. Some characters in the mask string serve as [placeholders](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/402516/data-editors/masks/text-masks#placeholders) for digits or letters, while others are [literals](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/402516/data-editors/masks/text-masks#literal-characters) used to separate value sections.

Masked Input activates a text mask if you bind the component’s [Value](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMaskedInput-1.Value) property to a string object. To enable this mask type in other cases, set the component’s [MaskMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMaskedInput-1.MaskMode) property to MaskMode.Text. 

The **Placeholder** сombobox and **Save Literals** radio button specify the placeholder character and whether to save literals to the editor’s value, respectively.
