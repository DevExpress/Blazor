The [Memo](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMemo) component is a multi-line editor that stretches to fit the parent container's width, by default. To change this behavior, use the following properties:

*   [Rows](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMemo.Rows) - Specifies the number of text lines displayed by the editor.
*   [Columns](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMemo.Columns) - Specifies the editor's display width in characters.
