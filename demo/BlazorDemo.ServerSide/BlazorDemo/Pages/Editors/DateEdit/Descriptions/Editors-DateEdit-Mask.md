Our [Date Edit](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDateEdit-1) component supports masked input. If you specify a mask, the input box only accepts values in a specific date format.

To enable this functionality, assign the pattern to the component’s [Mask](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDateEdit-1.Mask) property. The [DxDateTimeMaskProperties](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDateTimeMaskProperties) component specifies additional mask settings (such as culture or caret mode).  For more information about Date-Time masks, refer to the following help topic: [Date-Time Masks](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/402515/data-editors/masks/date-time-masks).

Try the **Mask**, **Caret Mode**, and **Culture** settings to explore the different date-time mask modes.
