In this demo, our Blazor [Date Edit](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDateEdit-1) displays values but does not allow users to modify them. To implement this behavior, you can use any of the following:

*   Read-only mode: In this mode, you can use the keyboard to focus and navigate the component. Set the [ReadOnly](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDateEdit-1.ReadOnly) property to **true** to activate this mode.
*   Disabled mode: In this mode, the component cannot be focused or navigated. Set the [Enabled](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxDataEditorBase-2.Enabled) property to **false** to activate this mode.
