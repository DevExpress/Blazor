This demo illustrates how to use the [MaxFileSize](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxUpload.MaxFileSize) and [AllowedFileExtensions](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxUpload.AllowedFileExtensions) properties to limit the maximum file size and specify file extensions that the [Upload](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxUpload) component accepts. Note that the [Upload](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxUpload) validates files on the client side. This demo also shows how to validate file extensions on the server side.
