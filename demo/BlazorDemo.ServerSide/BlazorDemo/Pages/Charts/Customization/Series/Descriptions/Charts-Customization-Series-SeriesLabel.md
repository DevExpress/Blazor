The [DxChartSeriesLabel](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartSeriesLabel) component allows you to customize a label's position, visibility, background color, and connector appearance. Use the event argument's **PointLabel** property in the [CustomizeSeriesPoint](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartBase.CustomizeSeriesPoint) event handler to access a label's customization settings. In this demo, points' labels are visible if their values are between 25 and 75.

The [DxChartSeriesLabel](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartSeriesLabel) component also supports font customization. To specify font properties of a series label, use the [DxChartFont](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartFont) component.
