This demo illustrates how to use [Candlestick](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartCandlestickSeries-3) series within the [Chart](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChart-1) component. In this module, the candlestick series displays stock price changes for a day. Each series point consists of a rectangle (body) whose bottom and topmost values correspond to the open and close price of a stock. A vertical line (shadow, wick or tail) displays the high and low price for the stock. If the stock closes higher than its open price, the corresponding body is not filled. If the stock closes lower than its open price, the corresponding body is filled.
