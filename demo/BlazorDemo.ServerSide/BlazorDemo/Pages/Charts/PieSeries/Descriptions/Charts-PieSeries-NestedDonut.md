A nested donut allows you to visualize multiple pie and donut series in one component. It is helpful when the displayed series values are related but belong to different categories.  

In this demo, Pie and Donut series use the same value field (`SalesInfo.Amount`) to show the relation between series values. The code groups values by city for the Donut series and by region for the Pie series.
