DevExpress Blazor [Chart](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChart-1) component allows you to define how axis labels are arranged. When axis labels overlap, use the [Overlap](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartAxisLabel.Overlap) property to rearrange them. You can select one of the following options:

* `Hide` — Hide overlapping axis labels.
* `None` — Leave axis labels overlapped.
* `Rotate` — Rotate axis labels at the angle specified by the [RotationAngle](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartAxisLabel.RotationAngle) property.
* `Stagger` — Stagger axis labels across two rows. Use the [StaggeringSpacing](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartAxisLabel.StaggeringSpacing) property to specify the space between rows.

In this demo, you can use the drop-down menu to rearrange overlapping axis labels.
