The DevExpress Blazor [Scheduler](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxScheduler) allows you to add custom properties to appointments, labels, and status items. To create these custom elements, define custom fields in source objects and add them to the [CustomFieldMappings](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxSchedulerMappingsBase.CustomFieldMappings) collection. In this demo, an appointment's source object includes an **Accepted** custom field that is mapped to the **IsAccepted** appointment property. The property value is used in the [HorizontalAppointmentTemplate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxSchedulerDayViewBase.HorizontalAppointmentTemplate) and [VerticalAppointmentTemplate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxSchedulerDayViewBase.VerticalAppointmentTemplate) to change appointment appearance.

The Scheduler also allows you to customize the appointment edit form as needed. Use the following properties to construct your custom form layout:

*   [AppointmentFormLayout](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxScheduler.AppointmentFormLayout) - the layout of the pop-up form that appears when you create an appointment and click the expand button or when you edit an appointment.
*   [AppointmentCompactFormLayout](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxScheduler.AppointmentCompactFormLayout) - the layout of the compact form that appears when you create an appointment.

The Scheduler ships with a set of predefined form layout items ([DxSchedulerSubjectFormLayoutItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSchedulerSubjectFormLayoutItem), [DxSchedulerStartDateFormLayoutItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSchedulerStartDateFormLayoutItem), [DxSchedulerStartTimeFormLayoutItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSchedulerStartTimeFormLayoutItem), etc). You can also add a custom item ([DxSchedulerCustomFormLayoutItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSchedulerCustomFormLayoutItem) ) and define its [Template](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSchedulerCustomFormLayoutItem.Template) property. In this demo, custom layout items are used to display the **IsAccepted** property's editor and its validation summary.

To pass information about custom properties to the edit form, implement a custom descendant from the [SchedulerAppointmentFormInfo](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.SchedulerAppointmentFormInfo) class and assign it in the [AppointmentFormShowing](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxScheduler.AppointmentFormShowing) event handler.

To enable form validation, mark appointment properties in your custom class with [annotation attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/validation) and set the Scheduler's [ValidateEditForm](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxScheduler.ValidateEditForm) property to **true**.

You can also specify which appointment form users can use to create and edit appointments: the compact form, the pop-up form, or both. To do this, use the [AppointmentFormMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxScheduler.AppointmentFormMode) property.
