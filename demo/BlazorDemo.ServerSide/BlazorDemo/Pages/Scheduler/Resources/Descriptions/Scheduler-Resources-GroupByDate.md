This demo illustrates how you can group scheduled appointments by date. When appointments are grouped by date and the Scheduler component displays multiple dates and resources, resource headers are grouped under date headers.

To group appointments by date, set the [GroupType](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxScheduler.GroupType) property to **Date**.
