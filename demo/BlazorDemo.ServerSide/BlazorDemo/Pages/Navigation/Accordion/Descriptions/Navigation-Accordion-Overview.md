The DevExpress Accordion for Blazor allows you to display collapsible panels and better organize information on pages with space constraints. You can also use this component as a navigation control and arrange navigation links within a multi-level UI structure. In addition, our Blazor Accordion control includes built-in filter UI elements to help users to locate information displayed within the component.

The Accordion stores its root-level elements in the [Items](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxAccordion.Items) collection. For each item, you can specify its text, icon, and child items or [collapsible content](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxAccordionItem.ContentTemplate). Items can be expanded or collapsed using the [slide animation effect](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxAccordion.AnimationType).

The following properties help manage a user’s ability to expand and collapse items:

* [ExpandMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxAccordion.ExpandMode) - Specifies how many items can be expanded at a given point in time.
* [ExpandCollapseAction](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxAccordion.ExpandCollapseAction) - Specifies the action that expands or collapses the item.
