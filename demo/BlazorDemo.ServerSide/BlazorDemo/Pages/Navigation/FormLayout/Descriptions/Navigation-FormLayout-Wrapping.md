All [layout items](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxFormLayout#layout-items) are rendered as **.col** elements within a single **.row** container by default. An item moves to the next row if there are not enough columns within the current row. You can also use an item’s [BeginRow](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.FormLayoutItemBase.BeginRow) property to explicitly indicate that it should be placed onto a new row.

Refer to the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) for additional information on the Bootstrap Grid system.
