The [Data Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1) component allows users to click a row to select it. Use the [SingleSelectedDataRow](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1.SingleSelectedDataRow) property to specify the selected data row in code. To track selection changes in this mode, use the [SingleSelectedDataRowChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDataGrid-1.SingleSelectedDataRowChanged) event or the two-way synchronization as demonstrated in this module.
