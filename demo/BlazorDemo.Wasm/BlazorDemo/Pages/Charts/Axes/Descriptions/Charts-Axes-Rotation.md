The [Chart](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChart-1) component allows you to swap the argument (X) and value (Y) axes and display the X axis vertically and the Y axis horizontally. To do this, set the chart’s [Rotated](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChart-1.Rotated) property to **true**.

This demo shows two charts bound to the same data source. The chart on the left has the default axes, and the chart on the right has swapped axes.
