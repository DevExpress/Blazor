All [layout items](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxFormLayout#layout-structure) are rendered in a single container. An item moves to the next row if there is not enough space in the current row. You can also use an item's [BeginRow](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.FormLayoutItemBase.BeginRow) property to explicitly indicate that it should be placed onto a new row.
