In both Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly applications, you can use the [GridDevExtremeDataSource\<T>](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridDevExtremeDataSource-1) to bind our Blazor [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/grid) to a large [IQueryable\<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.iqueryable-1) data collection. This data source implementation is based on our [DevExtreme.AspNet.Data](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data) library. When you use this data source, the Grid delegates data processing operations to an underlying query provider and only loads data required for screen display. This helps improve overall performance and reduces memory consumption.  

To use this data source in your next Blazor project, create a [GridDevExtremeDataSource\<T>](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridDevExtremeDataSource-1) class instance and pass your [IQueryable\<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.iqueryable-1) data collection as the constructor parameter. Once complete, assign this instance to the Grid's [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.Data) property. 
 
For more information about this data source and associated limitations, refer to the following help topic: [Large Data (Queryable Collections)](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403737/grid/bind-to-data#large-data-queryable-collections).
