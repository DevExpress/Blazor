Our Blazor [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/grid) is a data-aware component that allows you to display and manage tabular data with absolute ease. In this demo, the DevExpress Blazor Grid is bound to a data collection available during synchronous component initialization. To replicate this sample, bind the [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.Data) parameter to a C# field or property and populate this field or property with data inside the [OnInitialized](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/lifecycle?view=aspnetcore-6.0#component-initialization-oninitializedasync) lifecycle method. 
 
To display data within the Blazor Grid, declare [DxGridDataColumn](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridDataColumn) objects in the [Columns](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.Columns) template and use each object's [FieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridDataColumn.FieldName) property to assign data fields.
