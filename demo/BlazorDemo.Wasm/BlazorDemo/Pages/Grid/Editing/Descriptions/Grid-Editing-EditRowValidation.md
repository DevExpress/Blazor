Our Blazor Grid uses the standard [DataAnnotationsValidator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/forms-validation#data-annotations-validator-component-and-custom-validation-1) to validate user input (based on [data annotation attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/validation) defined in an edit model). Once a user removes focus from data editors or attempts to save an edited row, editors are outlined in colors and display validation icons: green for valid values, and red â€” invalid values. Hover the mouse pointer over an error icon to show the corresponding error message in the title.

You can implement your custom validator components and declare them in the [CustomValidators](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.CustomValidators) template. To disable input validation, set the [ValidationEnabled](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.ValidationEnabled) option to `false`.

**Note**: You should not rely on form validation alone to secure your Blazor-powered app. Form validation is designed to improve usability. A threat actor can bypass validation and send malicious data to the server. To minimize security related threats/risks, you must validate user input using multiple strategies. Refer to the following topic for more information: [Validate User Input](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/404263/common-concepts/validate-user-input).
