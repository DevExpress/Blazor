Our Blazor [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/grid) component can compute summaries for content in its entirety and at each individual group level. Total summaries are calculated across all Grid records and displayed in the Grid's footer. To create total summaries, declare [DxGridSummaryItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem) objects in the [TotalSummary](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.TotalSummary) template. 

Key DxGridSummaryItem properties are summarized below. 

* [SummaryType](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem.SummaryType) — Specifies the aggregate function (Sum, Min, Max, Avg, or Count). 
* [FieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem.FieldName) — Specifies the name of the data field whose values are used to calculate the summary. The Min and Max functions support data fields whose values can be compared. The Avg and Sum functions work with numeric fields only. For the Count function, you do not need to set this property. 
* [FooterColumnName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem.FooterColumnName) — Specifies the name of the column used to display the summary. If you do not define this property, the summary value is displayed under the column bound to the same data field. 
* [ValueDisplayFormat](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem.ValueDisplayFormat) — Specifies the pattern used to format the summary value. If you do not define this property, the summary applies the format from the column bound to the same data field. The Grid supports standard formats. For more information, see the following help topic: [Format types in .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/formatting-types). 
* [Visible](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem.Visible) — Allows you to show/hide individual summary items.
