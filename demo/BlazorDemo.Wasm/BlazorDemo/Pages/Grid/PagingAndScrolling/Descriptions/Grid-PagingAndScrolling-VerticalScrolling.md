The DevExpress Blazor [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid) displays a vertical scrollbar when Grid content height exceeds the specified height of the component itself.

In this demo, the Grid contains **30** rows on a page (the [PageSize](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.PageSize) property is set to **30**), but overall Grid height is limited by a CSS rule.
