This demo illustrates how to use the Table control to create a table report. This control allows you to draw a data-aware table and apply report styles (for example, to odd and even table rows).
In this demo, the XRTableCell.TextFitMode property is used to adjust the Supplier column's font size and occupy the available cell space.
