You can use the [Layout Breakpoint](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxLayoutBreakpoint) component to adapt page layout to different screen sizes. The [IsActive](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxLayoutBreakpoint.IsActive) property activates a specific breakpoint that corresponds to [DeviceSize](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxLayoutBreakpoint.DeviceSize), [MinWidth](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxLayoutBreakpoint.MinWidth), or [MaxWidth](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxLayoutBreakpoint.MaxWidth).

In this demo, the **IsActive** property is bound to the **isXSmallScreen** data field. When the screen is extra small, the breakpoint is activated, and the grid control hides its **Contact Title** and **City** columns. (You can also change column visibility regardless of screen size. Use the [Column Chooser](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.ShowColumnChooser(System.String)) window for this purpose.)
