Our Blazor [Window](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxWindow) component can display multiple windows simultaneously. You can use the [ShowAtAsync](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxWindow.ShowAtAsync.overloads) method overloads to open windows in a specific sequence/order. Users can switch between windows and interact with associated content as necessary. When a window is focused, it overlaps other visible windows.
