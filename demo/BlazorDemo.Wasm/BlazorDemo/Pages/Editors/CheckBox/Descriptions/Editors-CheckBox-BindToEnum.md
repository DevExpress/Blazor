The [CheckBox](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCheckBox-1) allows you to bind its states (check, uncheck, indeterminate) to custom data types. This module demonstrates how to bind the component to an Enum object.

*   [ValueChecked](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCheckBox-1.ValueChecked) — Specifies a value that is considered as Checked.
*   [ValueUnchecked](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCheckBox-1.ValueUnchecked) — Specifies a value that is considered as Unchecked.
*   [ValueIndeterminate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCheckBox-1.ValueIndeterminate) — Specifies a value that is considered as Indeterminate.

A value is considered as Indeterminate if it is not equal to the specified properties.
