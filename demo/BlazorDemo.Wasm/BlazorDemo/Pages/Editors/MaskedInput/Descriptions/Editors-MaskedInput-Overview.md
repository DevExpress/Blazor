The [Masked Input](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMaskedInput-1) component is a text editor that supports the following mask types:

*   Text 
*   Numeric 
*   Date-Time 
*   Regular Expression 

For more information on a specific mask type, refer to the corresponding section below.

The Masked Input component also allows you to enable client-side (WebAssembly) masks in Blazor Server applications. In this mode, the editor processes input text on the client to reduce input delays when you have a slow connection. For more information on how to activate the mode and its basic principles, refer to the following section: [Optimize Mask Performance in Blazor Server Apps](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/402513/data-editors/masks#optimize-mask-performance-in-blazor-server-apps).

Demo card headers display drop-down lists on the right-hand side. Use these controls to apply different size modes to editors. To do the same in code, use the [SizeMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxResizableEditorBase-2.SizeMode) property.
