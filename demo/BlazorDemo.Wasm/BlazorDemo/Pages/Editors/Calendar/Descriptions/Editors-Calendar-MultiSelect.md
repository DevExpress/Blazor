The [Calendar](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCalendar-1) component allows users to select multiple dates: individual dates, date ranges, or a combination of both.

Set the [EnableMultiSelect](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCalendar-1.EnableMultiSelect) property to `true` to enable multiple date selection. The [SelectedDates](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCalendar-1.SelectedDates) collection stores selected dates. To handle selection changes, use the [SelectedDatesChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCalendar-1.SelectedDatesChanged) event.

Users can select dates using the mouse or [keyboard](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCalendar-1##multiple-date-selection).

To add dates to a selection, select the dates while pressing the Ctrl key. 

To select a range of dates, select the initial date, press the Shift key, and select the last date.
