The [ComboBox](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxComboBox-2) component provides access to item values. The value is assigned to the editor's edit value when a user selects an item from the drop-down list. To enable this access, set the [ValueFieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxComboBox-2.ValueFieldName) property to the name of the data source field that ships with values for the ComboBox items.

If the **ValueFieldName** property is not specified, the ComboBox component searches for a **Value** field in the data source and uses this field as a value field. Otherwise, values are not assigned to editor items.

To access a selected item’s value, use the [Value](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxComboBox-2.Value) property. To track selection changes, use the [ValueChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxComboBox-2.ValueChanged) event or two-way synchronization as demonstrated in this module.
