Use the [DropDownWidthMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxComboBox-2.DropDownWidthMode) property to specify the width of a drop-down list.

*   [ContentOrEditorWidth](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DropDownWidthMode) (Default) — The list's width is equal to the width of the longest list item or the editor's width (whichever is larger).
*   [ContentWidth](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DropDownWidthMode) — The list's width is equal to the width of the longest list item.
*   [EditorWidth](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DropDownWidthMode) — The list's width is equal to the editor's width. List items are cut if they do not fit.

In this demo, [ContentOrEditorWidth](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DropDownWidthMode) mode is used for both ComboBox components. To change the width of their drop-down lists, use the **Drop Down Width Mode** option below.
