In this demo, several dates within the Blazor [Date Edit](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDateEdit-1)'s calendar are grayed out (disabled) and cannot be selected. If a user clicks one a disabled date, the Blazor Date Edit's selected date does not change.

To disable selection of specific dates based on custom logic, use the [CustomDisabledDate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDateEdit-1.CustomDisabledDate) event.
